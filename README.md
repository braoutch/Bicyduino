# Bicyduino
An advanced bicycle speedometer made with an arduino

Speedometer for bike, made with an Arduino, a Hall-Effect sensor & an
ILI9340 tft screen. (For now).
Thanx to Adafruit for the Drivers, and to XarkLabs for an even better
driver (https://github.com/XarkLabs/PDQ_GFX_Libs).

- Measures and displays speed, average speed, distance and time.
- Pause when you stop your bicycle.
- Refresh Display every 5sec very fastly.

Next step : accelerometer & interruptions !
